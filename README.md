NeatShift is a Windows utility designed to solve a common problem: moving large applications, games, or folders to a different drive without breaking the shortcuts and application paths that depend on them.

When a program is installed, its location is registered with the operating system. Simply moving the folder to a new drive will cause the program to stop working. NeatShift provides a robust solution by relocating the folder and then creating a **Symbolic Link** in its original place. This link is a powerful type of shortcut that is transparent to the operating system, redirecting any request from the old path to the new location seamlessly.

### Common Use Cases:
*   **Free Up SSD Space:** Move large game installations (e.g., from Steam or Epic Games) from a primary solid-state drive to a larger hard drive without needing to reinstall them.
*   **Centralize Data:** Consolidate project files, documents, or media libraries onto a network-attached storage (NAS) or secondary drive while maintaining their original, accessible paths.
*   **System Organization:** Reorganize the directory structure of a development environment or user profile without disrupting dependencies or breaking build scripts.

NeatShift automates the process of moving data and creating these links through a clean, modern interface, with built-in safety features like System Restore point creation.

##  What You'll Need

### Bare Minimum:
* Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763)
* Admin rights (for creating links)
* 100 MB of space

### For the Best Experience:
* Windows 11
* An SSD (because faster is better)
* System Restore turned on (just in case)

##  About Those Admin Rights

NeatShift needs admin privileges for two things:

1. **Making Symbolic Links**: Windows is picky about who gets to create these
2. **System Restore Points**: Better safe than sorry!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads Up!

NeatShift is still young and growing. While I've added safety nets like automatic restore points:

1. **Back Up**: Maybe create a restore point yourself - just to be extra safe
2. **Work in Progress**: We're actively improving things
3. **No Guarantees**: It works on my machine(s), but you know how that goes
4. **Double-Check**: Always verify your links work as expected
