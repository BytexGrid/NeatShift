## Administrator Privileges

NeatShift requires administrator privileges for two essential functions:

1. **Creating Symbolic Links**: Windows security model requires elevated privileges to create symbolic links. This is a system-level security requirement to prevent potential misuse of links.

2. **System Restore Points**: Creating system restore points requires access to system protection settings, which is only available with administrator rights.

1. **Manual Backups**: We strongly recommend creating manual system restore points or file backups before using the application
