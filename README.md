## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

* Windows 7 SP1 or later
* Administrator privileges
* 100 MB free disk space

### Recommended

* Windows 10/11
* SSD for faster file operations
* System Restore enabled (for safety features)

## Administrator Privileges

NeatShift requires administrator privileges for two essential functions:

1. **Creating Symbolic Links**: Windows security model requires elevated privileges to create symbolic links. This is a system-level security requirement to prevent potential misuse of links.
2. **System Restore Points**: Creating system restore points requires access to system protection settings, which is only available with administrator rights.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

NeatShift is currently in testing phase. While we implement safety measures like automatic system restore points, please note:

1. **Manual Backups**: We strongly recommend creating manual system restore points or file backups before using the application
2. **Testing Phase**: The application is under active development and testing
3. **No Warranty**: The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind
4. **User Responsibility**: Always verify symbolic links are working as expected after moving files
