Hey there! 👋 Ever get frustrated with messy files scattered across your PC? Let me explain what NeatShift does with a real example:

Imagine you have:
- Games in `C:\Games` (eating up your SSD space)
- Documents in `C:\Users\You\Documents` (getting cluttered)
- Downloads everywhere

You want to move those huge game folders to your bigger HDD, but:
- Steam won't find the games anymore
- Shortcuts break
- File paths in your apps stop working

**That's where NeatShift comes in!** 🎮

It lets you:
1. Move those big game folders to `D:\Games`
2. Creates magical links so everything still works
3. Your PC thinks the files haven't moved at all!

Real-world uses:
- Move games to a different drive without breaking Steam
- Organize documents while keeping shortcuts working
- Clean up your SSD without breaking anything
- Keep your files organized YOUR way

Think of it like creating shortcuts, but WAY more powerful - apps can't even tell the files moved! 

> **Note**: English isn't my first language, so you might spot some quirks in the documentation. Feel free to suggest improvements!

## 💻 What You'll Need

### Bare Minimum:
* Windows 7 SP1 or newer
* Admin rights (for creating links)
* 100 MB of space

### For the Best Experience:
* Windows 10/11
* An SSD (because faster is better)
* System Restore turned on (just in case)

## 🔑 About Those Admin Rights

NeatShift needs admin privileges for two things:

1. **Making Symbolic Links**: Windows is picky about who gets to create these
2. **System Restore Points**: Better safe than sorry!

## ⚠️ Heads Up!

NeatShift is still young and growing. While I've added safety nets like automatic restore points:

1. **Back Up**: Maybe create a restore point yourself - just to be extra safe
2. **Work in Progress**: We're actively improving things
3. **No Guarantees**: It works on my machine(s), but you know how that goes
4. **Double-Check**: Always verify your links work as expected
