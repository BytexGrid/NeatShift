## Administrator Privileges

NeatShift requires administrator privileges for two essential functions:

2. **System Restore Points**: Creating system restore points requires access to system protection settings, which is only available with administrator rights.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

NeatShift is currently in testing phase. While we implement safety measures like automatic system restore points, please note:

1. **Manual Backups**: We strongly recommend creating manual system restore points or file backups before using the application
2. **Testing Phase**: The application is under active development and testing
3. **No Warranty**: The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind
4. **User Responsibility**: Always verify symbolic links are working as expected after moving files
