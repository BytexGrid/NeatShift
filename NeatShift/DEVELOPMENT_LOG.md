   - Cleaned up service implementations
   - Improved MVVM structure
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Added proper documentation

4. **Testing Results**:
   - Tested with various file types
   - Verified hidden links work correctly
   - Confirmed settings persistence
   - Validated error handling

## Current State

### Working Features
1. ✅ File/folder movement with symbolic links
2. ✅ Hidden symbolic links
3. ✅ Settings management
4. ✅ Modern UI
5. ✅ Progress tracking
6. ✅ Error handling

### Known Issues
1. System Restore DLL might be missing on some systems
2. Requires admin privileges for symbolic links

### Next Steps
1. Implement settings dialog
2. Add link management tools
3. Improve error messages
4. Add batch operations

## Technical Notes

### Critical Components
1. **File Operations**
   ```csharp
   // Key method for moving files
   public async Task<bool> MoveWithSymbolicLink(string sourcePath, string destinationPath)
   ```

2. **Symbolic Links**
   ```csharp
   // Creates hidden symbolic links
   public static bool CreateSymbolicLink(string linkPath, string targetPath, bool isDirectory, bool hideLink = true)
   ```

### Important Paths
- Settings: `%AppData%/NeatShift/settings.json`
- Symbolic Links: Hidden in original locations
- Moved Files: User-selected destination

### Dependencies
- ModernWPF UI (UI framework)
- CommunityToolkit.Mvvm (MVVM framework)
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection (DI)
- System.Text.Json (Settings)
